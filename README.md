# Project-2

The purpose of this app is to explore market data. The user will be able to select what data will be pulled from the API and will also be provided with the option to download it as a .csv file. It will provide the ability to create contingency tables, numerical summaries and plots regarding the chosen data. 

-   A list of packages needed to run the app:

    -   `httr`, `jsonlite`, `tidyverse`, `shiny`, `DT`, `shinydashboard`

-   A line of code that would install all the packages used.

    -   `install.packages(c("httr", "jsonlite", "tidyverse", "shiny", "DT", "shinydashboard"))`

-   The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.

    -   `shiny::runGitHub(repo = "Project-2", username = "psoconne", subdir = "MarketData")`
