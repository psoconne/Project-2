# Project-2

Brief description of the app and its purpose.

-   A list of packages needed to run the app:

    -   `httr`, `jsonlite`, `tidyverse`, `shiny`

-   A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can
    easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).

    -   `library()`

-   The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio
    to run your app.

    -   ....
